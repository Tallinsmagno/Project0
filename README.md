# Project 0

The website that I have created is a humorous catalog listing
some of the most famous cursed image memes of cats on the
internet. The files are:
- index.html: this contains a description of the site as well as some example images of cats
- idle.html contains three images of idle cats followed by a descriptive analysis of the works displayed.
- grumpy.html contains four images of grumpy cats followed by a descriptive analysis of the works displayed.
- eating.html contains three images of hungry cats followed by a descriptive analysis of the works displayed.
- misc.html contains a table with six more images of
miscellaneous cat categories
- there are also a number of .jpg files needed for the pages
Each page has buttons that take you to each image displayed on that page.
